# Code Review: Document Editor Playground

## Summary
This repository implements a Next.js playground for multiple rich text editors. The PRD in `.dev/PRD.md` describes pages for TipTap, Toast UI, CodeX (Editor.js), Slate, Lexical and CKEditor 5 with plugin management, template loading and validation features.

## PRD Coverage
- **Implemented**: Home page with navigation and dark‑mode toggle, shared components (PluginManager, TemplateLoader, EditorIntegrationInfo). The TipTap page contains an extensive editor with plugin toggles, validation UI and template loader.
- **Missing/Partial**: Pages for Toast UI, Editor.js, Slate, Lexical and CKEditor show only a textarea placeholder without real editors【F:pages/ckeditor.tsx†L40-L45】. Planned TipTap extensions (heading lock, structure enforcement, watermark, sections, Yjs collaboration) are stubs. Property-based tests are skipped【F:tests/property/validation.test.ts†L5-L8】.

Overall coverage is partial; only a subset of tasks in `.dev/TASKS.md` are fully implemented.

## Integration & Maintainability Risks
- The TipTap page is nearly 400 lines long; splitting it into focused components would improve readability.
- Placeholder pages could mislead users; mark them as TODO or implement the actual editors.
- Template loading parses HTML via `DOMParser` without sanitization, so templates could inject scripts.
- TypeScript compilation fails because packages like `lucide-react` are missing【d446d7†L1-L11】.
- Stubbed extensions (heading lock, Yjs collab, etc.) are not wired into the editor.

## Performance Notes
- `lucide-react` icons are dynamically imported in `pages/tiptap.tsx`, but other large editor packages are eagerly loaded.
- Static templates and validation files are served with cache headers【F:next.config.js†L7-L27】.
- `framer-motion` is only used for navigation animations and could be replaced with CSS transitions.
- Consider lazy‑loading editor packages to reduce the initial bundle.

## Mandatory Fixes
1. **Install dependencies & pass TypeScript build** – `tsc --noEmit` fails due to missing modules and type errors【d446d7†L1-L11】【4a7ad3†L1-L11】.
2. **Run Prettier** – `npx prettier --check .` reports style issues in 46 files【8f6032†L1-L43】.
3. **Fix audit and test scripts** – `npm install` fails with a 403 error【7177b5†L1-L12】 which causes ESLint, Vitest, Playwright and Stryker to fail【071709†L1-L20】【f37df7†L1-L12】【d7d6b7†L1-L12】【9ce200†L1-L12】.
4. **Connect planned extensions** – implement or remove stub modules (e.g., heading lock, Yjs collab) to avoid dead code.

## Optional Improvements
- Refactor `pages/tiptap.tsx` into smaller components for maintainability.
- Add basic editor implementations for the remaining pages or clearly mark them as TODO.
- Consider dynamic importing of TipTap extensions and `lucide-react` icons.
- Replace Framer Motion with CSS transitions if animations are minimal.
- Enable property tests by removing `describe.skip` in `tests/property/validation.test.ts`.

# Code Review: Document Editor Playground

## Summary
This repository implements a Next.js playground for multiple rich text editors. The PRD in `.dev/PRD.md` describes pages for TipTap, Toast UI, CodeX (Editor.js), Slate, Lexical and CKEditor 5 with plugin management, template loading and validation features.

## PRD Coverage
- **Implemented**: Home page with navigation and dark‑mode toggle, shared components (PluginManager, TemplateLoader, EditorIntegrationInfo). The TipTap page contains an extensive editor with plugin toggles, validation UI and template loader.
- **Missing/Partial**: Pages for Toast UI, Editor.js, Slate, Lexical and CKEditor are present but only display a placeholder message (no editor integration). Features like heading lock, structure enforcement, watermark, sections, Yjs collaboration and advanced templates are stubbed or absent. Property‑based tests are skipped.

Overall coverage is partial; only a subset of tasks in `.dev/TASKS.md` are fully implemented.

## Integration & Maintainability Risks
- The TipTap page is a single file ~400 lines long. Splitting into smaller components would improve readability and testability.
- Placeholder pages could confuse users; adding feature flags or TODO notes might help.
- Validation code directly parses HTML with `DOMParser`. Sanitisation or escaping is not enforced when loading templates, so crafted templates could inject scripts.
- Typescript compilation currently fails without dependencies; ensure `node_modules` are installed before running CI.
- Many extensions such as heading lock and Yjs collaboration are only skeletons and not wired into the editor.

## Performance Notes
- `lucide-react` icons are imported directly in `pages/tiptap.tsx`. Dynamic imports could shrink the bundle as suggested in `PERFORMANCE_REPORT.md`.
- Caching headers for `templates` and `validation` are already configured in `next.config.js`【F:next.config.js†L7-L27】.
- `framer-motion` is used only for minor animations in `NavBar` and could be replaced with CSS transitions for a smaller bundle.
- Lazy‑loading of large editor packages (dynamic import) is recommended but not yet implemented.

## Mandatory Fixes
1. **Install dependencies & pass TypeScript build** – `tsc --noEmit` currently fails due to missing packages and type errors.【038109†L1-L35】
2. **Ensure prettier formatting** – `npx prettier --check .` reports style issues in multiple files.【d9e88d†L1-L12】【037960†L1-L29】
3. **Address audit/test failures** – `npm audit`, `vitest`, `playwright`, and `stryker` commands fail because packages cannot be fetched. A proper dependency installation step or offline cache is required.【6f4a01†L1-L12】【0ed5da†L1-L11】【07dd53†L1-L11】【312968†L1-L12】
4. **Connect planned extensions** – implement or remove stub modules (e.g., heading lock, Yjs collab) to avoid dead code and to meet PRD tasks.

## Optional Improvements
- Refactor `pages/tiptap.tsx` into smaller components for maintainability.
- Add basic editor implementations for the remaining pages or clearly mark them as TODO.
- Consider dynamic importing of TipTap extensions and `lucide-react` icons.
- Replace Framer Motion with CSS transitions if animations are minimal.
- Enable property tests by removing `describe.skip` in `tests/property/validation.test.ts`.

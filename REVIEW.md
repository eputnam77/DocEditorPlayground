# Code Review: Document Editor Playground

## Summary

This repository provides a Next.js playground with multiple rich text editors. The PRD in `.dev/PRD.md` requires individual pages for TipTap, Toast UI, CodeX (Editor.js), Slate, Lexical and CKEditor 5 along with plugin toggles, template loading and validation features.

## PRD Coverage

- **Implemented**: Home page with navigation and dark‑mode toggle. TipTap page demonstrates custom extensions, plugin toggles, template loader and validation panel. The README now explains how validation results appear in a panel【F:README.md†L120-L124】.
- **Missing/Partial**: Toast UI, Editor.js, Slate, Lexical and CKEditor pages still render only a textarea placeholder without real editors【F:pages/ckeditor.tsx†L40-L45】. Planned TipTap features like heading locking, structure enforcement and Yjs collaboration exist as stubs but are not fully wired up. Property-based tests exist but cannot run due to missing dependencies【817af9†L1-L24】.

Overall only part of `.dev/TASKS.md` is complete; remaining editor implementations and advanced TipTap features are pending.

## Integration & Maintainability Risks

- TipTap page is over 400 lines and mixes UI logic with state management—extract smaller components for readability.
- Placeholder pages could confuse users; consider implementing the actual editors or marking them clearly as TODO.
- Template loading uses `DOMParser` without sanitizing HTML, allowing script injection from templates.
- TypeScript build fails because packages such as `lucide-react` and `prosemirror-*` are missing【a1cdf2†L1-L18】.
- Stub extensions (heading lock, Yjs collab, watermark) increase bundle size but provide no functionality until integrated.

## Performance Notes

- `lucide-react` icons are dynamically imported in TipTap but large editor packages are eagerly loaded.
- Static templates and validation JSON are served with long‑term cache headers【F:next.config.js†L27-L45】.
- Navigation animations rely on `framer-motion`; simple CSS transitions might suffice.
- Consider code‑splitting optional extensions and editor libraries to reduce initial bundle size.

## Mandatory Fixes

1. **Install dependencies and fix TypeScript errors.** `tsc --noEmit` reports missing modules and type errors【a1cdf2†L1-L18】.
2. **Run Prettier.** Formatting check lists many files with style issues【d3d06d†L1-L30】.
3. **Resolve failing npm scripts.** `npm install` and subsequent lint/test commands fail due to 403 errors fetching packages【64a5ab†L1-L21】【c93578†L1-L27】.
4. **Hook up or remove stub extensions** so dead code does not linger.

## Optional Improvements

- Break `pages/tiptap.tsx` into smaller components.
- Provide functional implementations for the other editor pages.
- Lazy‑load editor packages and optional extensions.
- Replace `framer-motion` with CSS transitions if animation needs are simple.
- Enable property‑based tests once dependencies are installed.

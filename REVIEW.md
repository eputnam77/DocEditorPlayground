# Code Review: Document Editor Playground

## PRD Coverage

- The PRD outlines pages for six editors with plugin toggles, validation and template loaders【F:.dev/PRD.md†L23-L61】.
- Current implementation still uses placeholder `contentEditable` elements for most editor pages. TipTap page implements extensions but Yjs collaboration is stubbed.

## Integration & Maintainability

- `package-lock.json` adds Yjs-related deps and `@next/bundle-analyzer`【F:package-lock.json†L42-L46】【F:package-lock.json†L46-L47】.
- `next.config.js` sets long-term caching headers for templates and validation files【F:next.config.js†L20-L40】.
- TypeScript compilation fails due to an invalid command type in `tiptapIndentation`【d29eb2†L1-L8】.
- Vitest and Playwright suites fail with "React is not defined" errors and Playwright misconfiguration【0c2f66†L1-L5】. See
  [Running Tests](README.md#running-tests) for the current sandbox constraints on installing Playwright browsers.

## Performance Notes

- Bundle analyzer is configured, enabling size inspections.
- Static assets are aggressively cached.

## Blocking Issues 🔴

1. `tsc --noEmit` reports type errors in `extensions/tiptapIndentation.ts` which must be resolved before merging.
2. Unit and E2E test suites fail; Playwright tests are misconfigured and multiple React imports are missing (reference
   [Running Tests](README.md#running-tests) before retrying in the sandbox).
3. `.coverage` and `.venv` directories appear in the working tree; ensure they are ignored and not committed.
4. Editor pages lack real editor integrations contrary to PRD requirements.

## Info 🟢

- Prettier and ESLint checks pass.
- The new dependencies will allow Yjs collaboration and property-based tests.
- Cache-control headers follow the performance report.

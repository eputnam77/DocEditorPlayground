# End-to-End Test Report

**Status:** ‚ùå Tests skipped (stubbed Playwright)

Running `npx playwright test` outputs `playwright stub` because the repository bundles stub executables in `node_modules/.bin`. Real dependencies are not installed and this environment lacks internet access. To execute the full suite, run `bash scripts/setup.sh` in a networked environment and then `npx playwright test`.

## Summary

No scenarios were executed.

<h1>Effects of Aerobic Exercise on Cognitive Function in Older Adults</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This study investigates the impact of regular aerobic exercise on cognitive performance in adults aged 65 and older. Results indicate significant improvements in memory and executive function.</p>
<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Aging is associated with cognitive decline. Recent research suggests that physical activity may mitigate these effects.</p>
<h3>2. Methods</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Participants: 120 adults, ages 65-80</li>
  <li>Design: Randomized controlled trial</li>
  <li>Intervention: 30 minutes of aerobic exercise, 5 days/week, for 6 months</li>
  <li>Assessments: MMSE, Trail Making Test, Stroop Test</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Results</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Significant improvement in MMSE scores (p &lt; 0.01)</li>
  <li>Faster completion times on Trail Making Test</li>
  <li>Improved Stroop Test accuracy</li>
</ol>
<h3>4. Discussion</h3>
<p>Regular aerobic exercise is associated with enhanced cognitive function in older adults. Further research is needed to determine optimal exercise regimens.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>"Physical activity is a promising intervention for age-related cognitive decline."</p>

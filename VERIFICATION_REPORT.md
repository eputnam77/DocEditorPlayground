# Verification Report

## ✅ Implemented Features

- **Next.js project with Tailwind setup** — `package.json` lists Next.js, Tailwind and scripts for build/test【F:package.json†L1-L19】【F:tailwind.config.js†L1-L6】.
- **Home page with navigation** — `pages/index.tsx` renders navigation bar linking to each editor page【F:pages/index.tsx†L18-L36】【F:components/NavBar.tsx†L5-L35】.
- **Editor pages** implemented for TipTap, Toast UI, CodeX, Quill, Slate, Lexical and CKEditor 5 with toolbars and plugin toggles【F:pages/tiptap.tsx†L91-L343】【F:pages/toast.tsx†L20-L117】【F:pages/codex.tsx†L22-L180】【F:pages/quill.tsx†L20-L137】【F:pages/slate.tsx†L24-L158】【F:pages/lexical.tsx†L1-L317】【F:pages/ckeditor.tsx†L1-L161】.
- **Dark mode toggle** component and unit test【F:components/DarkModeToggle.tsx†L1-L51】【F:tests/components/DarkModeToggle.test.tsx†L1-L13】.
- **Basic unit tests for pages/components** under `tests/pages` and `tests/components`【F:tests/pages/index.test.tsx†L1-L11】.
- **CI workflow** configured to run tests on pull requests【F:.github/workflows/ci.yml†L1-L17】.
- **Integration guides documentation** describing plugin management for each editor【F:docs/integration-guides.md†L1-L34】.

## ⚠️ Partially Implemented Features

- **Template examples and validation utils** — validation helpers exist and are tested property-based, but no `templates/` directory or template loader components【F:utils/validation.ts†L1-L24】【F:tests/property/validation.property.ts†L1-L25】.
- **Modern page designs & advanced toolbars** appear in editor pages but lack validation areas or template loaders; shared components `PluginManager`, `TemplateLoader`, `EditorIntegrationInfo` are missing despite being planned in PRD/TASKS.
- **Tests** exist but the `vitest` binary is stubbed, so coverage and execution are skipped (see `npm run test:coverage` output showing `vitest stub - tests skipped`)【9d171f†L1-L8】.
- **E2E tests** defined in `.feature` files but Playwright tests were not executed; `tests/E2E_REPORT.md` notes missing dependencies【F:tests/E2E_REPORT.md†L1-L10】.

## ❌ Missing Features

- **Template loaders, validation UIs, integration code sections** described in PRD are not implemented.
- **Commenting and track changes**, **template integration improvements**, **validation status display**, and **expanded test coverage** from TASKS are absent.

## 📋 Recommended Next Steps

1. Implement shared components for plugin management, template loading and integration info across pages as outlined in tasks 10 and 18.
2. Add a `templates/` directory with example templates and integrate them into each editor page.
3. Add validation UIs and live status display per PRD section 5.2 and task 21.
4. Replace stubbed `vitest` and Playwright binaries with real dependencies to run unit, property and e2e tests and measure coverage ≥75%.
5. Expand toolbar functionality and styles as planned in task 17 and modern design enhancements from task 16.
6. Implement commenting/track-changes features where supported and increase test coverage for new functionality.

**Routing decision:** `ready-for:builder` — a builder should address missing functionality and enable real test execution.

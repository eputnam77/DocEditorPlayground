# Performance Optimization Report

This audit identifies opportunities to improve build and runtime speed in the Document Editor Playground. Tools such as k6, Lighthouse, Chrome DevTools and React Profiler should be used locally to gather metrics. Network access was unavailable in this environment, so recommendations are based on static inspection.

## Safe to Try

### Recommendation: Enable Next.js bundle analyzer
- **Description:** Install `@next/bundle-analyzer` and run `ANALYZE=true npm run build` to inspect bundle size. This helps identify large dependencies such as TipTap extensions.
- **Expected Impact:** Moderate (smaller JS bundles)
- **Effort Required:** Low
- **Breakage Risk:** Low
- **Dependencies:** Node modules required
- **Priority:** P1 (quick win)
- ready-for:builder

### Recommendation: Set Cache-Control headers for static templates
- **Description:** Configure `next.config.js` or hosting settings to cache files under `public/templates/` and `public/validation/` using long-lived `Cache-Control` headers.
- **Expected Impact:** Moderate (faster template loading)
- **Effort Required:** Low
- **Breakage Risk:** Low
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Priority:** P1 (quick win)
- ready-for:builder

### Recommendation: Run Lighthouse on production build
- **Description:** Generate a production build (`npm run build && npm start`) then run Lighthouse to measure performance, accessibility, and best practice scores.
- **Expected Impact:** Low to Moderate (insight into slow UI components)
- **Effort Required:** Low
- **Breakage Risk:** Safe
- **Dependencies:** Build output
- **Priority:** P1
- ready-for:verifier

## Review Needed

### Recommendation: Split heavy editor extensions into dynamic imports
- **Description:** Lazy-load optional TipTap extensions and large icon libraries using `dynamic(() => import('...'))` to reduce initial JS payload.
- **Expected Impact:** High (faster page load)
- **Effort Required:** Moderate
- **Breakage Risk:** Moderate (requires code changes and testing)
- **Dependencies:** Bundle analysis results
- **Priority:** P2
- ready-for:builder

### Recommendation: Introduce service-worker caching
- **Description:** Implement a service worker (e.g., with Next PWA plugin) to cache template files and validation JSON for offline use.
- **Expected Impact:** Moderate
- **Effort Required:** Moderate
- **Breakage Risk:** Moderate
- **Dependencies:** Testing in all browsers
- **Priority:** P3
- ready-for:builder

### Recommendation: Profile validation logic with React Profiler
- **Description:** Use the React Profiler in development to measure re-renders when toggling extensions or running validation. Optimize state updates to minimize unnecessary renders.
- **Expected Impact:** Low to Moderate
- **Effort Required:** Low
- **Breakage Risk:** Safe
- **Dependencies:** Development tools
- **Priority:** P2
- ready-for:verifier

# Verification Report

This report cross-references `.dev/PRD.md` with `TASKS.md` and the current codebase.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

* **Project skeleton**: Next.js + TypeScript present in `package.json` and `pages/` setup. See `package.json` lines 1‚Äë20 for dependencies and scripts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented Features

* **Initialization with Tailwind**: no Tailwind config found although package exists.
* **Templates and validation utilities**: placeholder file `templates/example.json` and `utils/validation.ts` throw TODO errors.
* **CI configuration**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` exists but minimal and uses Node 18.
* **README**: minimal description without setup instructions.

## ‚ùå Missing Features

* Home page navigation and all editor pages `/tiptap`, `/toast`, `/codex`, `/quill`, `/slate`, `/lexical`, `/ckeditor` are TODO stubs.
* Shared components `PluginManager`, `TemplateLoader`, `EditorIntegrationInfo`, and `DarkModeToggle` are not implemented.
* No working validation logic or templates.
* Tests are placeholders that intentionally fail.
* No integration tests or Playwright setup.

## üìã Recommended Next Steps

1. **Builder**: Implement pages and components per `TASKS.md`.
2. **Builder/Testers**: Replace failing placeholder tests with meaningful unit and integration tests; configure Tailwind and CI correctly.
3. **Docwriter**: Expand README with installation, usage, and contributing instructions.
4. **Planner**: Revisit task breakdown after implementation begins to ensure coverage.

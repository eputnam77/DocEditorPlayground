# Verification Report

This report cross-references `.dev/PRD.md` with `TASKS.md` and the current codebase.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

* **Project skeleton**: Next.js + TypeScript with Tailwind configured. See `package.json` and `tailwind.config.js` for setup.
* **Home page with navigation** linking to all editor pages. See `pages/index.tsx`.
* **Basic editor pages** with plugin manager, template loader and integration info placeholders (e.g. `pages/tiptap.tsx`).
* **Shared components** including `PluginManager`, `TemplateLoader`, `EditorIntegrationInfo`, `DarkModeToggle` and `NavBar`.
* **Validation utility** `utils/validation.ts` and sample templates under `templates/`.
* **Tests** for components and pages plus a property-based test.
* **CI workflow** in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
* **README** with setup instructions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented Features

* Editor pages use a simple `<textarea>` instead of real editor packages.
* Templates are minimal examples only.
* Coverage levels could not be verified ‚Äì test dependencies were not installable in this environment.

## ‚ùå Missing Features

* Integration tests using Playwright are absent.
* No real editor integrations (TipTap, Toast UI, etc.).
* Additional documentation beyond the README and ADRs.

## üìã Recommended Next Steps

1. **Builder**: Integrate actual editors on each page and expand template samples.
2. **Tester**: Ensure unit test coverage ‚â•75‚ÄØ% and add Playwright integration tests.
3. **Docwriter**: Extend documentation for contributors and editor integrations.

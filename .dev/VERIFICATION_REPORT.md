# Verification Report

This report cross-references `.dev/PRD.md` with `TASKS.md` and the current codebase.

## ✅ Implemented Features

* **Project skeleton** with Next.js + TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. See `package.json` and `tailwind.config.js`.
* **Home page with navigation** and dark mode toggle – `pages/index.tsx` and `components/DarkModeToggle.tsx`.
* **Rich editor pages** for TipTap, Toast UI, CodeX, Slate, Lexical and CKEditor 5. Example implementation in `pages/tiptap.tsx` shows extension management and toolbar.
* **Validation utility** `utils/validation.ts`.
* **Unit tests** for pages and components (e.g. `tests/pages/index.test.tsx`).
* **CI workflow** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
* **Documentation** including README, ADRs and `docs/integration-guides.md`.

## ⚠️ Partially Implemented Features

* Plugin toggles now use the shared `PluginManager` component across pages.
* Example templates added under `templates/` and loaded via `TemplateLoader`.
* Each page links to integration docs via `EditorIntegrationInfo`.
* Coverage and E2E tests cannot be run – Playwright and Vitest binaries are missing in this environment.

## ❌ Missing Features

<!-- All major features implemented -->
<!-- Placeholder section kept for future items -->

## 📋 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Tester**: Install real testing dependencies so unit and Playwright tests execute with coverage ≥75 %.
2. **Docwriter**: Document how to use templates and display validation status in the editors.

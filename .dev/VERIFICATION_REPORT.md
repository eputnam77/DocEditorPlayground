# Verification Report

This report cross-references `.dev/PRD.md` with `TASKS.md` and the current codebase.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

* **Project skeleton** with Next.js + TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. See `package.json` and `tailwind.config.js`.
* **Home page with navigation** and dark mode toggle ‚Äì `pages/index.tsx` and `components/DarkModeToggle.tsx`.
* **Rich editor pages** for TipTap, Toast UI, CodeX, Slate, Lexical and CKEditor 5. Example implementation in `pages/tiptap.tsx` shows extension management and toolbar.
* **Validation utility** `utils/validation.ts`.
* **Unit tests** for pages and components (e.g. `tests/pages/index.test.tsx`).
* **CI workflow** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
* **Documentation** including README, ADRs and `docs/integration-guides.md`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented Features

* Plugin toggles are implemented per page rather than via shared `PluginManager`/`TemplateLoader` components.
* No template examples are present even though validation helpers exist.
* Integration how‚Äëto documentation lives in `docs/` but pages do not display it.
* Coverage and E2E tests cannot be run ‚Äì Playwright and Vitest binaries are stubbed.

## ‚ùå Missing Features

* Template loader UI and sample templates (`TASKS #10` and `#11`).
* Commenting/track changes support (`TASKS #19`).
* Validation status display below editors (`TASKS #21`).

## üìã Recommended Next Steps

1. **Builder**: Add shared `PluginManager` and `TemplateLoader` components with sample templates and wire them into each page.
2. **Tester**: Install real testing dependencies so unit and Playwright tests execute with coverage ‚â•75‚ÄØ%.
3. **Docwriter**: Document how to use templates and display validation status in the editors.

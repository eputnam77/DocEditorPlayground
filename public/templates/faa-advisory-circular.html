      The styles in this template are one acceptable format that uses the paragraph numbering required by Order 1320.46D, FAA Advisory Circular System. That order is the definitive source of guidance for developing an AC. Should this template conflict with that guidance, or if the order is subsequently updated, you should follow the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last page of your AC should contain a feedback form. You should leave the headers and footers blank on the feedback form, and you should not label it an appendix. You should also include the following reference to the feedback form before the signature block:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “If you have suggestions for improving this AC, you may use the form at the end of this AC.”
    </blockquote>
    
    <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
    <p>[Purpose goes here]</p>
    
    <h2>2. Applicability</h2>
    <p>
      The guidance provided in this AC is for manufacturers, modifiers, foreign regulatory authorities, and FAA engineers, and their designees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents of this AC do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way. This AC is intended only to provide information to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies. Conformity with the guidance is voluntary only and nonconformity will not affect rights and obligations under existing statutes and regulations. The FAA will consider other methods of demonstrating compliance that an applicant may elect to present. Terms such as “should,” “may,” and “must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of compliance when the acceptable method of compliance in this document is used. If the FAA becomes aware of circumstances in which following this AC would not result in compliance with the applicable regulations, the FAA may require additional substantiation as the basis for finding compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This material does not change or create any additional regulatory requirements or authorize changes in or permit deviations from existing regulatory requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>7.1 Heading 2</h3>
    <p>Use title case in heading 2 (i.e., capitalize the principal words but not articles, conjunctions, and prepositions).</p>
    <h4>7.1.1 Heading 3</h4>
    <p>Use title case in heading 3.</p>
    <p>This is the “Levels 1-3 – One Paragraph Under Heading” style. Use this style when you only have a single paragraph of text under a heading in the AC body or in an appendix.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>7.1.2 This is the “Levels 1-3 – Bullet” style. Use this style for all bullets under the heading 1 through 3 paragraph styles in the AC body and headings 7 through 9 in the appendices.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>7.1.3 This is the “Levels 1-3 – Ordered List” style. Use this style to create an ordered list under the headings 1 through 3 paragraph styles in the AC body and headings 7 through 9 in the appendices.</li>
      <li>7.1.4 If you need to create other ordered lists in the AC, you will need to restart the numbering each time you begin a new ordered list. To restart the numbering, right-click on the paragraph text, then select “Restart at 1.”</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is the “Levels 1-3 – Equation” style. See below for an equation example. Use this style for equations under the heading 1 through 3 paragraph styles in the AC body and headings 7 through 9 in the appendices.</p>
    <div class="note">This is the “Levels 1-3 – Note” style. This style is used under the heading 1 through 3 paragraph styles in the AC body and headings 7 through 9 in the appendices. Use this style when there is only one note under a paragraph.</div>
    <div class="note">This is the “Levels 1-3 – Numbered Notes” style. This style is used under the heading 1 through 3 paragraph styles in the AC body and headings 7 through 9 in the appendices. Use this style when there is more than one note under a paragraph. Each time you add another set of numbered notes, you will need to restart the numbering. To do so, right-click on the paragraph text, then select “Restart at 1.”</div>
    <h4>7.1.1.1 Heading 4</h4>
    <p>Use title case in heading 4.</p>

    <h2>8. Table of Contents</h2>
    <p>You are not required to have a table of contents (TOC) in a short AC, but you may add one if it will help the reader navigate the document. Using this template allows you to easily auto-generate one. See Microsoft Word Help for guidance on auto-generating a TOC.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Tables/Figures</h2>
    <p>
      There are two styles available for formatting a table/figure: “Caption” and “Caption Image (for Figure).” You can use the “Caption” style to format the table/figure number and heading. Place the caption above the table/figure. You can use the “Caption Image (for Figure)” style to format the paragraph alignment behind a figure/picture.
    </p>
    
    <h2>10. Variables</h2>
    <p>
      This template contains four predefined character styles that you can use to create subscript or superscript text, which you might typically use when referring to a variable in an equation: “Variable Subscript,” “Variable Subscript + Bold,” “Variable Subscript + Italic,” and “Variable Superscript.”
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="feedback-form">11. AC Feedback Form</h2>
    <p>
      For your convenience, the AC Feedback Form is the last page of this AC. Note any deficiencies found, clarifications needed, or suggested improvements regarding the contents of this AC on the Feedback Form.

    <h4>A. Heading 6, Appendix No./Name</h4>
    <h5>A.1 Heading 7, Appendix Level 1</h5>
    <h6>A.1.1 Heading 8, Appendix Level 2</h6>
    <p><strong>A.1.1.1 Heading 9, Appendix Level 3</strong></p>
    <p>A.1.1.1.1 Heading 10, Appendix Level 4.<br>
      The “Heading_10,Appendix Level 4” style is not autonumbered because Microsoft Word limits multilevel lists to nine headings. If you use this style, you will need to manually type the paragraph number.</p>
    <p>A.1.1.1.1.1 Heading 11, Appendix Level 5.<br>
      The “Heading_11,Appendix Level 5” style is also not autonumbered. If you use this style, you will need to manually type the paragraph number.</p>

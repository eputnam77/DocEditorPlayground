# ADR 0001: Use Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project aims to provide a playground for experimenting with multiple rich text editors. We need a lightweight but flexible framework that supports modern React features, file-based routing and easy styling.

## Decision
We will bootstrap the project using **Next.js** with **TypeScript** for strong typing and **Tailwind CSS** for rapid prototyping. Next.js offers out-of-the-box routing, server-side rendering when needed and a simple developer experience. Tailwind allows a consistent design system without maintaining a custom CSS framework.

## Consequences
* Project code will live inside a typical Next.js structure using the `pages/` directory.
* Tooling such as `tsconfig.json` will be based on the defaults generated by `create-next-app`.
* Tailwind configuration will be added once styling begins.

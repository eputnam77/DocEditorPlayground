# Toast UI Usage Scenarios

Toast UI Editor was removed from active development but the playground keeps a placeholder page for reference.

## Track changes

1. Visit `/toast`.
2. Integrate the Toast UI Editor package to enable editing.
3. The **Track Changes** component will then summarize modifications below.

## Add comments

Use the **Add Comment** field to keep notes with the document.

## Lock down headings

Implement a custom plugin that restricts allowed heading levels if you integrate the full editor.

## Yjs collaboration

Pair Toast UI with Yjs by broadcasting editor events through a provider service. Collaboration is not included out of the box.

## Section nodes

Wrap content in movable blocks labelled with Heading&nbsp;2 if you need reordering.

## Custom watermark

Insert an overlay element containing the watermark text.

## Indentation

Utilize built-in list or block quote indentation options once the real editor is installed.

## Structure enforcement

Validate your markdown output to ensure headings appear in the desired order.

# CKEditor 5 Usage Scenarios

CKEditor 5 can replicate the playground features with plugins or custom builds.

## Track changes

1. Navigate to `/ckeditor`.
2. Make edits in the placeholder field.
3. The change summary below reflects character differences.

## Add comments

Use the **Add Comment** box to store feedback. CKEditor's own comments plugin can replace this widget in a production build.

## Lock down headings

Create a plugin that restricts which heading levels are allowed in the document.

## Yjs collaboration

CKEditor supports real-time collaboration with its commercial packages. Connect your Yjs provider to sync data if using open-source builds.

## Section nodes

Wrap each Heading&nbsp;2 in a container element so entire sections can be reordered via drag and drop.

## Custom watermark

Overlay a positioned element with your watermark text. Hide it when exporting the content.

## Indentation

Use builtâ€‘in list and indentation commands to nest content where needed.

## Structure enforcement

Validate the editor output before saving to ensure required headings appear in order.
